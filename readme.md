Comparing efficiency of 2 recursive Fibonacci position>value alogs:
1. straight up recursion value=(position-1)/(position-2);
2. recursion w/memoizaton;
3. simple iteration.

Caution: entering a position number over 35 or so will result in a long wait or stack overflow as algo 1 is fully recursive.
